# Align Technologies candidate home task
# developed by Guy Shachar

Tasks to do list:
Part 1:
Endpoint: POST /mission
Body: {“agent”: “[codename]”, “country”: “[country]”, “address”: “[address string]”, “date”: “[date and time]”}
Adds a mission.
See the sample data below.

Part 2: 
Endpoint: GET /countries-by-isolation An isolated agent is defined as an agent that participated in a single mission. Implement an algorithm that finds the most isolated country (the country with the highest degree of isolated agents). For the sample input (see below) input:
Brazil has 1 isolated agent (008) and 2 non-isolated agents (007, 005)
Poland has 2 isolated agents (011, 013) and one non-isolated agent (005)
Morocco has 3 isolated agents (002, 009, 003) and one non-isolated agent (007)
 So the result is Morocco with an isolation degree of 3.

Part 3:
Find the closest mission from a specific address (any existing mission’s address)

Endpoint: POST /find-closest
          Body: {“target-location”: “[an address or geo coordinates]”}

<b>Developer comment:<b>

<li>For Geo functionality I implemented Google Geocordinate API</li>
<li>I Deployed the applicaiton into Google Cloud platform, using Docker & K8S</li>
<li>Application is exposed in Google Cloud using the following url http://35.193.212.227/</li>
